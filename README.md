Implemented a client-side routing system using React Router to handle navigation and display different views for completed
and non-completed tasks; utilized controlled forms for creating new to-do items, and added form validation using React
hooks. Also, executed real-time data updates using WebSockets, developed reusable components and managed the applicationâ€™s state
using the Redux library.
